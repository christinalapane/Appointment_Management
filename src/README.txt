To use the program you log in on the login screen.
You'll then be taken to a main screen where you can view all the appointments, as well as all the customers.
There are two radio buttons which will show the weekly and monthly appointments. The appointment table updates. Press clear to show all.
There are buttons where you can add, modify, or delete appointments or customers. To delete or modify, you select an appointment or customer.
To add or modify, you'll be taken to another screen where you'll enter in information needed.
For appointments, you can only choose from valid business hours and valid days.

On the main screen there is a button for reports, which takes you to a different screen. On the reports screen you'll see three tables.
The top one is all appointments. You can select contacts from the combo box at the top to see which contacts have appointments scheduled.
The bottom right includes the type of appointment, which month, and how many.

The additional report I included is the table on the right. It shows the contacts that have appointments scheduled, and how mnay they have all year.
